# Section Header here

## Here is a slide {.smaller}
here is some text

## Here is another slide

## Here are some bullets

* bullet 1

* bullet 2

## Lets do bullets incrementally

>- bullet 1

>- bullet 2

## Another way {.build}

- bullet

- bullet

# Loading in data

## Just as normal

```{r dataload}
theData <- read.csv("data/demo.csv")

theData
```


- RELATIVE PATHS

>- YOU ARE NOT WORKING ALONE

## Working on data

- Do it normally

```{r dataManipulate}
library(tidyverse)
dataClean <- theData %>% select(COUNT_MALE, COUNT_FEMALE)
dataClean
```

# images

```{r image}

# ignores root.dir, have to type full relative path
knitr::include_graphics("../images/dropout.png")

```

Here is something describing the image

# Plots

## Plots with ggplot


```{r ggplotting, fig.cap = "a plot", fig.width = 7, fig.height = 7}
library(ggthemes)
ggplot(dataClean)  + geom_histogram(aes(x = COUNT_MALE), fill = "blue", alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = COUNT_FEMALE), fill = "red", alpha = 0.5) + theme_hc()

```


# External R code

##  Steps
 
1. Special @knitr comments

2. read_chunk(path to file)

3. Name your chunk same thing you named in special comment

4. Magic

## Including the code



```{r chunkread}
knitr::read_chunk("R/example.R")
```


```{r highchart1}
```

# Why will my file not knit

## Answer one

Check file paths

## ANswer two

DO NOT PUT INSTALL.PACKAGES IN AN RMD

```{r}
spongebobsay("Hello")
```
